# [Project 1 : Market Access and Pricing Analytics](https://github.com/hexekutive/powerbi_projects/tree/main/market_access_pricing)

![](Images/MAP%20Analytics%20Snapshot.png)

This project focused on bringing visibility over the current year, last year, and next year's prices, both with the current sales forecast and the fixed quarterly reference for comparison. 
The report should be simple, and highly flexible for end user's customization, with filters, page navigation, F.A.Q. section, and exportable to Excel.
The data should also follow strict rules on privacy, having established Row-Level Security using the user name. 
Data on SAP IBP was queried through oData, plus some Excel files stored in SharePoint online.
The report was published to a shared workspace and user adoption was tracked through the Usage Analytics functionality

# Project 2: Integrated Business Planning (IBP) Global Dashboard

(Repository on the making)

This is a Power BI project that I lead as the main data analyst, working closely with the business of a pharmaceutical company, to support the IBP Process (also known as S&OP). This process is critical for the success of the company, as it is the single source of truth for sales forecasts, and its output is used in manufacturing to ensure on-time and in-full delivery of medicines to patients. The dashboard serves around 800 stakeholders, and I was also in charge of upskilling them and keeping them up to date with the latest knowledge about the platform.
